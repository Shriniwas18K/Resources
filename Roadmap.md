## High Quality indepth content resources for learning anything in Core Java

First learn through these video resources or their accompanying handrwitten notes then go to next level books then to baeldung articles.
Its going from structured (notes videos) to unstructured scattered(articles).

### Video Resources and notes
1) Durgasoft core java with 8&9 new features (https://github.com/cM2908/core-java-notes)
2) Multithreading shandliya codes (make yourself its 4 hours simple tutorial)

### books
1) A functional approach to java (get from telegram channel https://t.me/DataScience_Books/4430)

### webpages
1) baeldung (universally everything in ecosystem of pure java and some libraries and spring is for surely here)

### Paths ahead 

# Server Side Engineering 
Considering that majroity Indian industries still relies on J2EE era legacy onpremise systems for ERP,CRM,PLM etc software development in companies like PTC,eQube hence the insitutes are establihsed which train students for J2EE(web-based) stuff only.
Whereas outside India companies goes more towards Spring way and modern java and AI integration , Cloud docker k8s etc microservices features.
1) building enterprise systems like CRMs,ERPs,PLMs,DaaS,backends solutions
2) two approaches : Spring and J2EE(Jakarata or Enterprise Java) ecosystems

### videos resources
1) J2EE (majorly used sections) from institutes like durgasoft telegram channels(nagoor babu teaches JSP,JDBC,Struts,Servlets,Hibernate) or youtube channels
- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWCgPRTQ8gYTls_28T5jlLZW8s63aqozv&feature=shared for Servlets
- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWCgPRTQ8gYRZnUGFS2gVdCIpG951M-C7&feature=shared for JSP
- https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd3UqWTnYXOniKfYRNY___weULTRd9Co0&feature=shared for JDBC
- Oracle database training from oracle SQL dev gym and live sql tutorials (its most used in Indian industry)
  
2) Spring (less to medium quality stuff yet good to get started at high level)
- https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessionalITTechnologies
- https://youtu.be/4XTsAAHW_Tc 
- https://www.youtube.com/@Java.Brains/
- https://spring.academy/courses
- https://www.youtube.com/@peachezprogramming/ (fastest option to build something)
  
### webpages
- https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/ (this is bible of J2EE , everything in J2EE is here even better then official docs, its actually well structured like book)
- spring vmware docs official are even too good organized and readable , easily understandable , but just vast , check reference api docs.

### books
- download the notes of institutes from telegram channels

# Android Engineering
Indian industry stays on legacy java way to develop apps and few of them prefer to develop using react-native,flutter way. Many are introducing kotlin to codebases. We are new to it so will write it later.
